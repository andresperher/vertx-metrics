## Introduction

This repository contains a basic Java server application based on [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) framework.

This server defines a simple REST API to manage basic memory operations, such as:

- Allocate a memory chunk (default: 100 MB)
- Deallocate a memory chunk.
- Deallocate all memory chunks.
- Force garbage collection.

The main purpose of this project is to allow developers to experiment with memory management in Java applications.
